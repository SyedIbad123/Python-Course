# Tuples in python programming
'''
01 : Tuples are immutable(* that can't change).
02 : In tuples we used round brackets() paranthesis.
03 : Tuples can't be updated..
'''

t = (1,2,3,4)
print(t)

# t[0] = 43   # throws an error bcz we cannot update tuples...

# Empty Tuple
t =  ()
print(t)

# Tuples with only one element
t = (1,) # We always writes comma after a tuple element..
t = (1) # wrong way...
print(t)
