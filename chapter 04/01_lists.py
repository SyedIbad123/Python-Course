# Lists
# 01 : list is the method to store data types..
 
a = [1,2,3,4] 
b = [1 , 2 , 3 , 4] # spaacing does not matters. list prints in same manner...
print(a)
print(b)


# list slicing 
# 01 : list slicing is same as string slicing..
a[0] = 7 # This replaces the number with index (*0)
print(a)

a = [1, "ibad", False, 89.92] 
print(a)
