# SUPER CLASS IN OOP..
# 01 : The Python super() function returns objects represented in the parentâ€™s class and is very useful in  multiple and multilevel inheritances to find which class the child class is extending first.
# 02 : It is used to access the methods of a super class in the derived class.
