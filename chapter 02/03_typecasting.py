# TYPECASTING : This is the method or way to convert one data type into another



a = "908" # this is a string bcz of double quotes in programming.

a = int(a) # (int is a function used for convert any data types into integer...),(a number can be converted into string and vice versa if possible...)

print(a + 1) # It generates an error bcz we add a string into number


b = 38
b = str(b) # (str is a function used for convert any data types into string...)
print(type(b))


c = 38
c = float(b) # (float is a function used for convert any data types into floating point...)
print(type(c))
