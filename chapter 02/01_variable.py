# 01 : variable = container to store a value or memory space..
# 02 : keywords = reserved words in python or any other languages.
# 03 : identifiers = class/ functions / variable names.

''' when we use containers(variables) i.e: a,b,c or any name(you are free hand about this) e.t.c.... and when we give it any entity(means value or memory space) to these variables than the entity is store in it and this entity may be (string represent by double or single quotes),(numbers, integers,floating point,double floating point,boolean,none)'''


# Data Types in python..

a = "ibad"   # 01 :string(we can use single and triple qoutes as well(with triple qoutes we can write multiple lines.))
b = 45       # 02 : number or integer
c = 78.90    # 03 : floating point
d = True     # 04 : boolean(either true or false but never both)
e = None     # 05 : none means nothing here..


# printing the variables.
# 01 : For output we use print function that is pre defined function in python.

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(d)
print(e)

# printing the type of variables
# 01 : we use (type(* any variable name here)) function to print the type of variables... 
print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
print(type(d))
print(type(e))


''' 1a = "ibad" ''' # we can't use numbers/symbol/digits in starting of variable(this generates a *syntax error*) instead we use it in the end of variable..

# 01 : variable name can only starts with a alphabets or underscore......
# 02 : no white space  is allowed to be used inside a variable name....
# 03 : variable name is case sensitive...
# 04 : We can either use camel case or snake case for assigning the variable.. Snake case is recommended for pyhton as it is found in the name of programming language.... snake case is like : lower_case_with_underscores.
