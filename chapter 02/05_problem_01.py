# program to add two numbers


#method 1 : Good practice..
a = 3
b = 4 
print("The sum of two numbers is ", a+b)


#method 2 :  this method is not A good practice bcz if we change the value of variable than the output is not desireable...
a = 3
b = 4 
print("The sum of two numbers is ", 3+4)



# method 3 : storing value in another variable ( this is best method for logical building)..
a = 3
b = 4
c = a+b 
print("The sum of two numbers is ", c)
