# CONCATINATION

# 01 : If we add same data types with each other and different data types with each other we use concatination.
# 02 : EIther we use comma(,) or plus sign(+) for concatination.


a = "34"     # This is string.
b = "ibad"   # This is also a string.
print(a + b)  # This will added.


a = 34       # This is an integer 
b = "ibad"   # This is a string
print(a+b)   # This throws an error but if we use here comma(,) the different data types is added.


a = "ibad"
print(a*3)  # This will print 3 times (ibad) bcz we use here multiply operator between variable and number.


word = "ibad"
print(word + "!")   # If we add something with vaiable we use string data type enclosed in(single,double or triple qoutes) with either comma or plus(+).
